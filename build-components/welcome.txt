This build system allows you to build the core Neutron wallet for
a number of operating systems and flavors. The build system is
continuously updated and integrated alongside new versions of the
Neutron wallet.

While it's not entirely clear, the Linux flavor not only builds
native versions for the underlying Linux distribution, but also
creates distribution independent binaries in the form of
AppImages.
